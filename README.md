### Project Euler
This repo contains my progress through the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems in Ruby and JavaScript. These solutions are by no means intended to be optimal, and in general I will move on to the next problem after solving one rather than continuously refactor my working solution.

I'm struck so far at just how much faster JS is than Ruby. This isn't unexpected, but for several of my initial solutions where Ruby might take 10-20s to run through several nested iterations, JavaScript has the answer waiting in the console almost instantaneously. The reward for not having so many convenience methods, I suppose!
